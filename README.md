# Threat Hunt Report: Unauthorized TOR Usage
- [Scenario Creation](https://github.com/KChinwe97/threat-hunting-scenario-tor/blob/main/threat-hunting-scenario-tor-event-creation.md)

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Tor Browser

##  Scenario

Management suspects that some employees may be using TOR browsers to bypass network security controls because recent network logs show unusual encrypted traffic patterns and connections to known TOR entry nodes. Additionally, there have been anonymous reports of employees discussing ways to access restricted sites during work hours. The goal is to detect any TOR usage and analyze related security incidents to mitigate potential risks. If any use of TOR is found, notify management.

### High-Level TOR-Related IoC Discovery Plan

- **Check `DeviceFileEvents`** for any `tor(.exe)` or `firefox(.exe)` file events.
- **Check `DeviceProcessEvents`** for any signs of installation or usage.
- **Check `DeviceNetworkEvents`** for any signs of outgoing connections over known TOR ports.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Searched the `DeviceFileEvents` Table

Searched for any file that had the string "tor" in it and discovered what looks like the user "employee" downloaded a TOR installer, did something that resulted in many TOR-related files being copied to the desktop, and the creation of a file called `tor-shopping-list.txt` on the desktop at `2024-11-08T22:27:19.7259964Z`. These events began at `2024-11-08T22:14:48.6065231Z`.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceFileEvents  
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"  
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName == "employee"  
| where FileName contains "tor"  
| where Timestamp >= datetime(2024-11-08T22:14:48.6065231Z)  
| order by Timestamp desc  
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, Account = InitiatingProcessAccountName
```

---

### 2. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table

Searched for any `ProcessCommandLine` that contained the string "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.1.exe". Based on the logs returned, at `2024-11-08T22:16:47.4484567Z`, an employee on the "threat-hunt-lab" device ran the file `tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.1.exe` from their Downloads folder, using a command that triggered a silent installation.

**Query used to locate event:**

```kql

DeviceProcessEvents  
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"  
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.1.exe"  
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, ProcessCommandLine
```

---

### 3. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table for TOR Browser Execution

Searched for any indication that user "employee" actually opened the TOR browser. There was evidence that they did open it at `2024-11-08T22:17:21.6357935Z`. There were several other instances of `firefox.exe` (TOR) as well as `tor.exe` spawned afterwards.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents  
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"  
| where FileName has_any ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe", "tor-browser.exe")  
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, ProcessCommandLine  
| order by Timestamp desc
```

---

### 4. Searched the `DeviceNetworkEvents` Table for TOR Network Connections

Searched for any indication the TOR browser was used to establish a connection using any of the known TOR ports. At `2024-11-08T22:18:01.1246358Z`, an employee on the "threat-hunt-lab" device successfully established a connection to the remote IP address `176.198.159.33` on port `9001`. The connection was initiated by the process `tor.exe`, located in the folder `c:\users\employee\desktop\tor browser\browser\torbrowser\tor\tor.exe`. There were a couple of other connections to sites over port `443`.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents  
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"  
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName != "system"  
| where InitiatingProcessFileName in ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe")  
| where RemotePort in ("9001", "9030", "9040", "9050", "9051", "9150", "80", "443")  
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessFolderPath  
| order by Timestamp desc
```

## Summary

The user abibiman on the device chinwe-th-s2 engaged in activities related to the Tor Browser on June 8, 2025, between 9:28:45 PM and 9:41:19 PM. The sequence of events began with the execution of firefox.exe, indicating the start of the Tor Browser. Shortly after, the tor.exe process was initiated, establishing network connections to remote IPs 94.23.68.187 and 89.58.12.210 on port 9001, confirming Tor network activity. The Tor Browser installer tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.5.3.exe was executed silently, resulting in the creation of several Tor-related files, including tor.exe, license files, and a desktop shortcut. Multiple firefox.exe processes were created, primarily for browser tabs and graphics rendering, indicating active use of the Tor Browser. Additionally, a file named tor- shopping-list.txt and its shortcut were created, suggesting user activity possibly related to Tor usage, though the purpose remains unclear. The consistent use of the Tor Browser and its network connections suggests deliberate engagement with the Tor network, potentially for anonymized browsing.---

## Response Taken

TOR usage was confirmed on the endpoint `abibiman` by the user `chinwe-th-s2`. The device was isolated, and the user's direct manager was notified.
